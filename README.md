# 2048-Game
a console clone of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) made in c++



## Prerequisites
cmake, cppunit
## Complilation
1. run
    cmake ./
2. run
    make

This will give you two files in bin directory,
1. 2048_game
2. tests_2048_game

The first one is the game, while the other one is the test file.
If the second one fails the game should not work properly.

## Instructions
use wasd to move, q to quit
